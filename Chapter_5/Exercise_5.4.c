// Write a program that asks the user to enter a height in centimeters and then displays the height in centimeters and in feet and inches.
// Fractional centimeters and inches should be allowed, and the program should allow the user to continue entering heights until a nonpositive value is entered.
// A sample run should look like this:
// Enter a height in centimeters: 182
// 182.0 cm = 5 feet, 11.7 inches
// Enter a height in centimeters (<=0 to quit): 168.7
// 168.0 cm = 5 feet, 6.4 inches
// Enter a height in centimeters (<=0 to quit): 0
// bye
